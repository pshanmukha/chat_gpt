The ChatGPT clone version app is a mobile application that allows users to chat with an AI-powered language model called ChatGPT. The app is built using the Flutter SDK and relies on OpenAI's REST APIs to interact with the language model.

The app utilizes various technologies and libraries such as Provider, Animated Loader, and Animated Text to enhance the user experience. The Provider library is used to manage application state and provide a scalable and efficient way to share data between different widgets. The Animated Loader is used to display a loading animation when the app is making API requests to OpenAI's servers. The Animated Text is used to add dynamic and engaging text effects to the user interface.
